# Data-Visualization-using-Tableau
Lab workbooks (.twb) and PDF reports (.pdf) from Semester 3: Data Visualization course focusing on Tableau, at CHRIST (Deemed to be University).
---

## Project Description

This repository contains the **Tableau lab workbooks** (`.twb`) and their corresponding **PDF lab reports** (`.pdf`) completed for the **Data Visualization** course during **Semester III** at **CHRIST (Deemed to be University)**.

Each PDF report includes detailed writeups, stepwise screenshots, and the final visualizations for each lab. The `.twb` files contain the Tableau development work and chart configurations used to create these outputs.

## Lab Index (Workbooks & PDF Reports)

Each lab has both a Tableau workbook (for code and dashboard creation) and a PDF report (for viewing results and documentation).

## How to Use This Repository

There are two convenient ways to explore the repository content:

### 1. **View the PDF Reports (Recommended)**

* The easiest way to understand the work and see results.
* Each PDF includes:

  * Stepwise explanation of data handling and visualization logic.
  * Screenshots of the final Tableau charts and dashboards.
* No additional software is required to view these files.

### 2. **Open the Tableau Workbooks**

* To explore how the visualizations were built:

  * Open any `.twb` file in **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public**.
* **Note:** The `.twb` files only store visualization structure, not the underlying dataset.
* If you want to make the workbooks portable in the future, export them as `.twbx` (Tableau Packaged Workbooks) to include the data files.
